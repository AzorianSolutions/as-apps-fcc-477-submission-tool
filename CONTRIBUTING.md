# Contributing to the FCC 477 Submission Tool

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to the project.

At this time, I am unable to manage a multi-contributor project and thus, can not accept contributions with any reliable
interaction. If you are interested in contributing on a large level, I will consider you for a maintainer role.
